# LIRI-node-app
LIRI is similar to SIRI, except it is a language interpretation and recognition interface.
LIRI takes in 4 commands: my-tweets, spotify-this, movie-this and do-what-it-says.
## Accessing the Twitter npm
### my-tweets
my-tweets will return the most recent 20 tweets of @rjrowland.
## Accessing the Spotify npm
### spotify-this
use the command spotify-this and then type in your _search_ to return information about the song you are looking up.
## Accessing the OMDb API
### movie-this
use the command movie-this and then type in your _search_ to return information about the movie you are looking up.
## Parsing files
### do-what-it-says
do-what-it-says will parse the random.txt file and perform the function inside, which will run spotify-this _"I Want It That Way"_ by the Backstreet Boys.
